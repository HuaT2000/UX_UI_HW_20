They need re-assurance that these services will be effective in helping them with their specific needs and that they will be supported throughout the process.</p>

      <h1 class="display-4">Problem Statement</h1>
      <p class="lead">After research and analysis, we determined our problem statement that immigrant youths and parents in Canada struggle to find trustworthy educational and social support programs on this website. We want to improve the communication of the program’s information, build organization credibility, and increase enrollment.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">

            In order to achieve this, we need to create a new modern and fresh-looking design through making a clearer navigation, incorporating icons and relevant images, including a filter and multi-language option, and adding mobile support. After, we did some user testing and iterated on this. With this comes we’d consider to be our future perspectives, such as regular maintenance and updates. We probably also need to add features to compete with similar organizations.

      <h5 class="card-title">User Flow</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Our User Flow is quite simple. We would have the user browse through the programs, filter to their preferences, and then choose a program that best suits their schedule. From there it’s just a matter of signing up by inputting their personal information. Once registered and they get the confirmation, they have the option to add the programs to their calendar or receive notifications through text or a follow-up phone call. </p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Site Map</h5>
      <p class="card-text">As mentioned, the existing website is cluttered with unorganized information, making navigation difficult for users. Additionally, some information is presented in photos and images, which made it harder to read and didn't align with the website’s design principles. Therefore we took on the task to simplify the information to better communicate these programs.

        <p class="card-text">We started at the top of the page by reorganizing the site header, which was previously too busy and confusing.  We removed the extra logo and moved the social network icons to the footer. We made sure to highlight the most important information on the page. Ultimately we built this prototype and did some user testing. </p>

        <p class="card-text">We defined the color palette, generally giving the existing colors more vibrancy, then we chose the type styles we will use. We defined a photography style then created interaction overlays using a gradient of our color palette.
